# Material Dialog Exercise

Here is my completed exercise, done in Angular 9 and with Material Components.

I ended up doing some work to make the interface select everything properly. Some of that work is probably past what I needed to do, but I've made an effort to make it easy to parse through.

I also separated a few components into their own files, just to make it convenient for me to regenerate additional instances of them.

You'll find the dialog code itself in `src/app/dialog`,
or https://github.com/NoahSylwester/MaterialDialog/tree/master/src/app/dialog.

If you clone this repo and run `ng serve`, you'll see that I've built out a nice little demo page for easy viewing.
